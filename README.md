# WELCOME TO MY LAIR

Welcome to the place where engineering brilliance, questionable life choices, and a touch of madness converge. By day, I’m a backend developer; by night, I’m elbow-deep in DIY projects that are either ingenious or utterly absurd, depending on who you ask.

I’m here because I *enjoy* creating things: sometimes things you can find in stores, sometimes things that exist only in the fevered dreams of an overengineering addict.

Expect a lack of instructions, some “experimental” wiring, and an open invitation to follow me down the rabbit hole of 3D-printed jank. If any of this breaks mid-project (or you do), remember: this is all part of the process.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or need emotional support, please don't reach out.
